# overriding docker run command 

docker echo hello there!! command will print out hello there!! 

Let's use docker run busybox ls it will display all the contents in busybox.

If we use busybox with echo then there is somewhere echo/ls present in the SF Snapshot. But in hello-world echo/ls doesn't work as there is no specification of echo/ls has been done in SF Snapshot of hello-world.
