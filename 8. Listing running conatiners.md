# Listing running Containers

To list all the containers up in the working state we use "docker ps".

here docker refers to the docker client and ps lists all the running containers.

"docker ps --all" lists all the conatiners created till now.

Now, lets take "docker run busybox echo hi there" it prints "hi there" but we cannot see its name in the running container list. Because it echo's out the written text and goes back into down state.

Now, lets try to use ping command in other terminal and execute the ps command in 1st terminal. So the command is "docker run busybox ping google.com". Now if we run ping command we get the output for ps command.

Note - use ctrl+c command to stop the requests of ping command.
