# Removing stopped containers

"docker system prune" used to remove :

- all stopped containers
- all networks not used by at least one containers
- all dangling image
- all build cache

it will also give total reclaimed space after running this command.

now as you execute "docker ps --all" there is no container available which has been stopped.

### As and when you are done working with docker run this command in order to free up all the containers.
