# Stopping containers

There are two commands used to stop the container :

## 1. stop

It gives termination signal i.e. SIGTERM to the container and waits for 10sec. to complete its processes and then responce back.

### docker stop container-id

## 2. Kill

It gives kill signal i.e. SIGKILL to the container and kills all the processes at that instant of time and responce back qwikly.

### docker kill container-id


example - 
docker run busybox ping google.com
docker ps //to get container-id
docker stop container-id //will take 10 sec. and return container-id
docker start container-id
docker kill container-id //instant reply by giving container-id
