# Container Lifecycle

creating and running a conatiner are two different tasks. 

docker run = docker create + docker start

create a container = "docker"(reference the docker client) "create"(try to create the container) "image name"(name of the image to use for this container)

start a container = "docker"(reference the docker client) "start"(try to create the container) "container id" ID the container to start

## what happens when the conatiner is only created and not started?

FS Snapshot from Image comes to the container and gets add in the hard drive segment for this process.

## what happens when the container is actually started?

Startup command is run on the container to actually start the container. example - "echo hi there!!".

##### docker create hello-world 
It gives the conatiner id as the output.

##### docker start -a "continer-id"
There will be welcome message printed from docker. "-a" is used to give whatever output is given by the conatiner. 

Note - without "-a" it will not give the container output but it just returns container ID if we use the command - "docker start container-id"
