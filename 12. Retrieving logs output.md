# Retrieving log outputs

### Get logs from a container using

#### docker logs container-id

if we use "docker start -a container-id" then it will give the output of the container but instead of it we can use "docker logs container-id" inorder to get the logs of the container in this case if we use "docker create busybox echo hi there" then the container-id is created these container returns container-id but if we use "docker logs container-id" it will return "hi there!!".
