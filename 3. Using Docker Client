 when we run the command "docker run hello-world" then some process occours at the backend and we get Hello from Docker! text displayed on our screen.

 -------------------------------------How this happens?--------------------------------------

 when we run the command "docker run hello-world" through CLI, that is, we are using Docker Client. Docker Client takes our command to Docker Server, this server checks the required image in image-cache. If it finds the image in image-cache, then it is easier and faster for the server to full-fill the demand of the client.
 //now there won't be any message "image not found"

----------------------But what if the image is not found in the image cache?-----------------

Docker server goes to the Docker Hub and there it finds the required image this server then giver the output through docker client. 

//"purpose of the hello-world image is just to write the output - Hello from docker!"

Docker Hub is the free service where many images are available
