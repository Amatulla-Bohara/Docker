# Restarting stopped container

If we run a command "docker run busybox echo hi there!!" then the output will be "hi there!!" as soon as it gets executed the container gets stopped and its status becomes "Exited(0)".

To start the container or to start it again we use "docker start container-id" and this will return the container-id but if we use "-a" i.e. "docker start -a container-id" then it will return whatever there is value inside the container like in this case it is "hi there!!" and this statement cannot be modified.
