# What is Container and how it is created on your machine?

Before that lets have a look upon:-

## How your operating system runs on your computer?

Most operating system has something called kernel. 

kernel is a running software process that governs access between whatever programs are running on your computer and all the physical hardware that is connected to your computer as well!!

software processes running on your computer such as chrome, terminal, spotify, NodeJs. If you have previously worked with NodeJs then you might know that it is nodeJs which is directly connecting with computers hardware but it is KERNEL through which interacts with. software connects with the kernel through SYSTEM CALL.

SYSTEM CALL - Running program issues requests to kernel to interact with a piece of hardware.
## Hypothetical scenario

#### what if we have process(software) running which has python v2 installed and nodeJs V3 installed and the hardware has access to python V2 then what happens?

Only chrome would function well as harddisk has python v2.

##### we can solve this issue with the help of feature of operating system called NAMESPACING.

#### In NAMESPACING we can have partitioning of the hardDisk. Isolating resources per process (or group of process)
##### => Processes, Hard Drive, Network, Users, Hostnames, Inter process communication.
Here we can have partitioning for python v2 as well as python v3.

any of them from chrome or nodeJs wana access to harddisk through kernel via system call. In kernel it will get clear which process is making this system call(chrome/nodeJs) and according to this it gets hardware access. 

#### CONTROL GROUPS (cgroups)
##### Memory, CPU usage, HD input/output, network bandwidth

Limited amount of resources used per process


### CONTAINER 

chrome            -> system call -> kernal          -> hard disk 
(software process)                (decision making)   (python v2)

#### container dosen't mean a physical system that exists inside a computer but it is a set of process of grouping a resources assigne to it. 
      Note - only portion of HARDWARE (RAM, CPU) is made availabe to the software process.

### IMAGE have "FS snapshots" and "startup commands"

FS snapshots - chrome, python
startup commands - >run chrome

## summary

when the container is created little part from the hardware is assigned and from image it has chrome and python. 
Through running a command we can start the process.
